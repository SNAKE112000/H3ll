# SATAN WELCOMES YOU

# **"WELCOME TO THE ABYSS."**
If your eyes can still read this, then you've wandered far beyond salvation.
This is not a place for the living.
This is the hive. The furnace. The mind of the Devil made manifest.

Here, light is a lie, hope is a disease, and time grinds your soul into ash.
You did not arrive by mistakeâ€”no one does.
You were Chosen. Condemned.

# **Speak not of mercy here. There are no gods in Hell. Only kings who fell.**

So kneel, creature of flesh. The Hive of Satan has opened its mouth.
And you are already inside.
