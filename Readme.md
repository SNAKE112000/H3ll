# SATAN WELCOMES YOU

# **WELCOME TO THE ABYSS.**
If your eyes can still read this, then you've wandered far beyond salvation.
This is not a place for the happiness.
This is pain. Hell. The mind of the Devils made Cyber.

In here, light is a lie, hope is a disease.
You did not arrive by mistakeâ€”no one does.
You were Chosen. Condemned.

# **Speak not of mercy here. There are no gods in Hell. Only kings who fell.**
